## Task: Integration Testing for Phase 3 (R5 + R6)

Verify the complete Phase 3 implementation works end-to-end.

### Backend Testing (article-mind-service)

Working directory: /export/workspace/article-mind/article-mind-service/

1. Run quality checks:
   ```bash
   make lint
   make typecheck
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. Test the embedding and search flow manually if possible:
   - Start the server
   - Create a session
   - Add an article with URL
   - Wait for extraction to complete
   - Trigger embedding generation
   - Run a search query

### Key Endpoints to Verify

- POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/articles/{article_id}/embed - Trigger embedding
- POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/search - Search session knowledge
- GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/search/stats - Get search statistics

### Report

Provide a summary of:
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Quality check results
- Any issues found
- Overall Phase 3 readiness status
